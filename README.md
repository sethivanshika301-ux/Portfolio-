# 👋 Hi, I'm Vanshika

Welcome to my **AI Product & Engineering Portfolio**.

This repository showcases a curated set of projects across **Generative AI, machine learning systems, cloud-native architectures, and product-led engineering**. Each project reflects hands-on execution, strong system design, and a focus on solving real-world problems at scale.

## 🔍 What you'll find here
- **Generative AI & LLMs**: RAG pipelines, embeddings, vector search, prompt engineering
- **Machine Learning Systems**: model evaluation, experimentation, and performance optimization
- **Cloud & Backend Engineering**: AWS-based architectures, scalable APIs, data pipelines
- **Product Thinking**: problem definition, metrics, trade-offs, and business impact

## 🎯 Focus
I specialize in building **production-ready AI-powered products**, bridging the gap between **technical depth and product strategy**. My work emphasizes scalability, usability, and measurable outcomes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (varies by project)
Python • SQL • AWS • Docker • APIs • ML/LLMs • Data Pipelines • Experimentation
